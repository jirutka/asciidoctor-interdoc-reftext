module Asciidoctor::InterdocReftext
  # Asciidoctor processor that adds support for automatic cross-reference text
  # for inter-document cross references.
  #
  # ### Implementation Considerations
  #
  # Asciidoctor does not allow to _cleanly_ change the way of resolving
  # xreftext for `xref:path#[]` macro with path and without explicit xreflabel;
  # it always uses path as the default xreflabel.
  #
  # 1. `xref:[]` macros are parsed and even converted in
  #    `Asciidoctor::Substitutors#sub_inline_xrefs` - a single, huge and nasty
  #    method that accepts a text (e.g. whole paragraph) and returns the text
  #    with converted `xref:[]` macros. The conversion is delegated to
  #    `Asciidoctor::Inline#convert` - for each macro a new instance of
  #    `Inline` node is created and then `#convert` is called.
  #
  # 2. `Inline#convert` just calls `converter.convert` with `self`, i.e. it's
  #    dispatched to converter's `inline_anchor` handler.
  #
  # 3. The built-in so called HTML5 converter looks into the catalog of
  #    references (`document.catalog[:refs]`) for reflabel for the xref's
  #    *refid*, but only if xref node does not define attribute *path* or
  #    *text* (explicit reflabel). If *text* is not set and *path* is set, i.e.
  #    it's an inter-document reference without explicit reflabel, catalog of
  #    references is bypassed and *path* is used as a reflabel.
  #
  # Eh, this is really nasty... The least evil way how to achieve the goal
  # seems to be monkey-patching of the `Asciidoctor::Inline` class. This is
  # done via {InlineNodeMixin} which is prepended* into the `Inline` class on
  # initialization of this processor.
  #
  # The actual logic that resolves reflabel for the given *refid* is
  # implemented in class {Resolver}. The {Processor} is responsible for
  # creating an instance of {Resolver} for the processed document and injecting
  # it into instance variable {RESOLVER_VAR_NAME} in the document, so
  # {InlineNodeMixin} can access it.
  #
  # Prepending* {InlineNodeMixin} into the `Asciidoctor::Inline` class has
  # (obviously) a global effect. However, if {RESOLVER_VAR_NAME} is not
  # injected in the document object (e.g. extension is not active), `Inline`
  # behaves the same as without {InlineNodeMixin}.
  #
  # _\* If running under Opal (JavaScript), {InlineNodeMixin} is not prepended
  # into the `Asciidoctor::Inline`, because Opal does not support that. Thus
  # it's included and the `#text` method is overriden using poor alias method
  # chain approach.
  #
  # NOTE: We use _reftext_ and _reflabel_ as interchangeable terms in this gem.
